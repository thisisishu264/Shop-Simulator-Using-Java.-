# Shop-Simulator-Using-Java.-
This project can create items in a shop and use shopping cart objects to add them. This is a continuation of my shopping list program but it is on Java. 
The program has the following features: 
1) Shop items can be created and added in the shop.
2) Users can create shopping carts (just like my previous prototype on python).
3) Multiple carts can be created, accessed, deleted and merged.
4) Items can be added in them, deleted and editted.
5) Shop items can be added.
6) Total item cost and entire cart cost can be found.

The program utilized classes, objects, inheritence, polymorphism (method overiding) and data encapsulation.
